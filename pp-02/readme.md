1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=12K0u0kuCubiTATn+vtvEnBBJix
Your Rationale:I chose this pastel green color because I have always associated a similar color to gaming because the xbox color is a green sort of like this. I think that this color works because it is kind of a bright happy color, but not too
masculine or feminine of a color so it can work well in advertising.

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=5320u0kWWFjsFTyL6VXWKsqVYlW
Your Rationale:I chose this color because obviously these three colors are all very much spring colors and are fairly bright and go along with the nature theme.

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=32E0u0k++KvudZMOE+V+WtZ+8nx
Your Rationale:I chose this palette because it is very bright and is the type if colors that children usually expect when
playing games or learning because the colors are good for holding onto attention because, usually, they are the brightest most eye catching colors in the room.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL:http://paletton.com/#uid=c3c3v3P480kWQllO+vJUdqiYpf+ZQ9k
Your Rationale:I chose this color palette because it is not a loud as some of the others and I believe that the blue shade of colors is a more professional color that shows that the company is serious and trustworthy.
